# docker_containerization_view
I applied nushell rust programming approach to docker containerization and created arrays from the same. A fresh way to view the docker containerization. Visualization of the dockers with nu shell programming to see which docker images are running and which are sleeping with custom messages. I also created an array out of the same. Also made a docker visualization tool using a shell to end json programming, more soon.
